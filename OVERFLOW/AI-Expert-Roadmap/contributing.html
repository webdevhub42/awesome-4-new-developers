<h2 id="the-goal">The Goal</h2>
<p>Our goal is <strong>not</strong> to have the biggest list of everything available out there. Our goal is to have a list of things that anybody would have to learn if they were to enter the field today.</p>

<ul>
<li>Clone the repository</li>
<li>Open <a href="https://www.draw.io/">draw.io</a> and drop the xml file of the image that you want to change in the browser to open it</li>
<li>Add your changes and add a link to each new content</li>
<li>Export the xml file <code>File &gt; Export as &gt; XML &gt; uncheck "compressed" &gt; Export</code> and put it in the <code>images</code> directory</li>
<li>Export the svg file <code>File &gt; Export as &gt; SVG &gt; uncheck "Include a copy of my diagram" &gt; Export</code> and put it in the <code>images</code> directory</li>
<li>Make sure that the width and height of the SVG match the actual image content to avoid unnecessary whitespace around the image</li>
<li>Commit your changes and open a PR</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adding everything available out there is not the goal!</strong><br />
The roadmaps represent the skillset most valuable in present time meaning that if you were to enter any of the listed fields today, that’s what you would learn first. Although there is an endless amount of techniques, tools and components that were important in the past or appear promising to become relevant in the future, prioritize the skills that are generally most relevant for today’s demand. Use your critical thinking to filter out non-essential stuff. Give honest arguments for why the resource should be included.</li>
<li><strong>One item per Pull Request</strong><br />
There may be a discussion related to an item you want to add. Adding just a single item per pull request makes it much easier for everyone involved.</li>
<li>Write meaningful commit messages</li>
<li>Look at the existing issues/pull requests before opening new ones</li>
</ul>
