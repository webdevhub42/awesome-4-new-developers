<h2 id="remember-keep-your-codebases-simple-yet-robust.">Remember: Keep your codebases <em>simple</em>, yet <em>robust</em>.</h2>
<p>If a newbie dev to your framework comes along and can‚Äôt grok the high level architecture within 10 minutes, it probably means that you went a little overboard in the engineering department.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you should <em>never</em> forgo following fundamental best practices for the sake of simplicity, lest we teach that same newbie dev the <em>wrong</em> way of doing things.</p>
<p>The quality &amp; architecture of Conduit implementations should reflect something similar to an early stage startup‚Äôs MVP: functionally complete &amp; stable, but not unnecessarily over-engineered.</p>
<h2 id="to-write-tests-or-to-not-write-tests">To write tests, or to not write tests?</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> ‚Äî we require a minimum of <strong>one</strong> unit test with every repo, but we‚Äôd definitely prefer all of them to include excellent testing coverage if the maintainers are willing to add it (or if someone in the community is kind enough to make a pull request :)</p>
<p>We think tests are a good idea, and we‚Äôre huge fans of TDD in general. However, building Conduit implementations without full testing coverage is a meaningful time investment as is, so we originally didn‚Äôt include full testing coverage in the spec because we figured that if people wanted it, then it would be a great ‚Äúextra credit‚Äù objective for the repo. For example, our Angular 2 repo had a request for unit tests and some awesome community members are now working on a PR for it.</p>
<p>Another reason we didn‚Äôt include them in the spec is from the ‚ÄúGolden Rule‚Äù above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The quality &amp; architecture of Conduit implementations should reflect something similar to an early stage startup‚Äôs MVP: functionally complete &amp; stable, but not unnecessarily over-engineered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most startups we know that work in consumer facing apps (like Conduit) don‚Äôt apply TDD/testing until they have solid product-market fit, which is smart because they then spend most of their time iterating on product &amp; UI and thus are far more likely to find PMF.</p>
<p>This doesn‚Äôt mean that TDD/testing === over-engineering, but in certain circumstances that statement does evaluate true (ex: consumer product finding PMF, sideprojects, robust prototypes, etc).</p>
<p>That said, we do <em>prefer</em> that every repo includes excellent tests that are exemplary of TDD/testing with that framework üëç</p>
<h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>
<p>‚ÄúConduit‚Äù is a social blogging site (i.e.¬†a Medium.com clone). It uses a custom API for all requests, including authentication. You can view a live demo over at https://demo.realworld.io</p>
<p><strong>General functionality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Authenticate users via JWT (login/signup pages + logout button on settings page)</li>
<li>CRU* users (sign up &amp; settings page - no deleting required)</li>
<li>CRUD Articles</li>
<li>CR*D Comments on articles (no updating required)</li>
<li>GET and display paginated lists of articles</li>
<li>Favorite articles</li>
<li>Follow other users</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="backend-specs">Backend Specs</h1>
<p>All backend implementations need to adhere to our <a href="https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/tree/master/api">API spec</a>.</p>
<p>For your convenience, we have a <a href="https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/blob/master/api/Conduit.postman_collection.json">Postman collection</a> that you can use to test your API endpoints as you build your app.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-starter-kit">starter kit</a> includes <a href="https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-starter-kit/blob/master/BACKEND_INSTRUCTIONS.md">references to the API specs &amp; testing</a> required for creating a new backend.</p>
