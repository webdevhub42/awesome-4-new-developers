<h1 id="building-a-browser-extension">Building a browser extension</h1>
<p>Building browser extensions is a fun and interesting way to think about the performance of your apps while building a different type of web asset. This module includes lessons on how browsers work and how to deploy a browser extension, how to build a form, call an API, and use local storage, and how to gauge the performance of your website and improve it.</p>
<p>You’ll build a browser extension that works on Edge, Chrome, and Firefox. This extension, which is like a mini web site that is tailored to a very specific task, checks the <a href="https://www.co2signal.com">C02 Signal API</a> for a given region’s electricity usage and carbon intensity, and returns a reading on the region’s carbon footprint.</p>
<p>This extension can be called ad hoc by a user once an API key and region code is input into a form to determine local electricity usage and thereby offer data that can influence a user’s electricity decisions. For example, it may be preferable to delay running a clothes dryer (a carbon-intense activity) during a period of high electricity usage in your region.</p>

<p>The idea for this web carbon trigger was offered by Asim Hussain, lead at Microsoft of the Green Cloud Advocacy team and author of the <a href="https://principles.green/">Green Principles</a>. It was originally a <a href="https://github.com/jlooper/green">web site project</a>.</p>
<p>The structure of the browser extension was influenced by <a href="https://github.com/onedebos/covtension">Adebola Adeniran’s COVID extension</a>.</p>
<p>The concept behind the ‘dot’ icon system was suggested by the icon structure of the <a href="https://energylollipop.com/">Energy Lollipop</a> browser extension for California emissions.</p>
