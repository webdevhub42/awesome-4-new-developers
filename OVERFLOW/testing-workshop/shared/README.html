<p>This is installed into the <code>client</code> and <code>server</code> directories as an actual dependency. This is accomplished by symlinking this directory into their respective <code>other</code> directories, and then they each install it as a file located in their <code>./other/shared</code> directories. This happens in the <code>install</code> step of the <code>setup</code> script.</p>
<p>This is done mostly for the server to be able to be deployed on its own.</p>
<p>There’s not a lot of code shared here (and mostly it’s just for tests), but I thought it would be fun to show one way to accomplish this kind of code reuse.</p>
<p>One important note is that these files are not transpiled at any point. So it’s a good idea to avoid using features not available in Node8 :)</p>
