<h3 id="explain-what-they-installed-last-night">Explain what they installed last night</h3>
<p>The Friday night install process is very cut-and-paste, and people new to Ruby don’t understand any of the things that they did. Show them the components (git, github, ruby, rails, heroku) and explain what each is for and how they fit together in plain language and ‘’why’’ each one is important. Diagrams can help. Don’t assume beginners have any context: for example, git is not the only version-control software out there, it is just one way to do it.</p>
<h3 id="make-sure-they-know-basic-nix-commands">Make sure they know basic *nix commands</h3>
<ul>
<li>Remember that some people don’t yet know that when you’re at the command line, you’re actually sitting in a folder, and when you change a directory it’s like moving into a folder with a GUI. This is NOT obvious if you’ve never used it before.</li>
<li>If they are learning this for the first time, give them a little challenge like: go into the Desktop folder, create a subfolder and then cd into it. Use pwd to prove you’re in the right place.</li>
<li>Check in to make sure everyone knows at least the following unix commands: <code>cd, ls, mkdir, irb, pwd</code>.</li>
<li>Explain what an argument and a flag are. curl -O http://whatever.com/text.txt</li>
<li>(Someone who knows DOS should write the equivalent of this section for DOS)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="explain-other-foundational-concepts.">Explain other foundational concepts.</h3>
<ul>
<li>How does a web server work?</li>
<li>What is versioning? Why would you need to use it?</li>
<li>What is the difference between running code at the command line and running code out of a file?</li>
<li>What is the difference between Ruby and Rails?</li>
</ul>
