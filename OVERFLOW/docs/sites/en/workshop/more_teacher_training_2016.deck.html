<h1 id="whats-a-ta">What’s a TA?</h1>
<h3 id="first-workshop-be-a-ta">First workshop? Be a TA!</h3>
<ul>
<li>At RailsBridge, a TA is a volunteer who isn’t leading the class.</li>
<li>If you’re volunteering at your first RailsBridge workshop, you should probably be a TA.</li>
<li>Sometimes they are the technical experts (rather than the teacher), sometimes not.</li>
<li>TAs often explain specific concepts for the class or teach a couple of sections to give the teacher a break from talking.</li>
<li>TAs can ask questions to encourage students to speak up.</li>
<li>Teachers can ask your TA to explain a concept; they may be more technically advanced than you!</li>
<li>TAs can help people who get lost.</li>
<li>Co-teaching is also an option if you feel like you can tag-team. There doesn’t have to be a hierarchy.</li>
<li>If someone falls behind, the TA can take them out of the room to do some 1-on-1, if there’s another TA in the room.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="railsbridge-teacher-training---soft-skills-edition">RailsBridge Teacher Training - Soft Skills Edition</h1>
<h1 id="how-to-make-your-class-awesome">How to make your class awesome</h1>
<p>We’ve made three quasi-arbitrary categories of ways to make your class awesome:</p>
<h5 id="we-want-our-students-to-feel">We want our students to feel:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Like you are approachable and can help solve their problems</li>
<li>Socially comfortable</li>
<li>Technically capable</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="discussion-is-key-dont-let-the-presenters-do-all-the-talking">Discussion is key! Don’t let the presenter(s) do all the talking!</h4>
<h1 id="social-comfort---establishing-trust-with-students-aka-do-you-know-whats-up">Social Comfort - Establishing trust with students aka “Do you know what’s up?”</h1>
<h4 id="discussion-points">Discussion points</h4>
<ul>
<li>How can you help people feel like you know what’s going on?</li>
<li>What are things you can do to help the students trust you?</li>
<li>What are some things to avoid?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="know-whats-up-ideas">Know What’s Up: Ideas</h1>
<h4 id="dont-be-afraid-to">Don’t be afraid to:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Call on people! By name!</li>
<li>Ask yourself questions and answer them.</li>
<li>Be vulnerable yourself, discuss your learning process</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="know-whats-up-even-more-ideas">Know What’s Up: Even More Ideas</h1>
<h4 id="pace-yourself">Pace yourself!</h4>
<ul>
<li>Don’t go too fast. You will probably go too fast. Check in occasionally to ensure everyone is still with you.</li>
<li>You can say the same thing THREE TIMES and it will not be boring yet.</li>
<li>When you ask a question, wait TEN WHOLE SECONDS before saying anything else. People need time to think.</li>
<li>Don’t let the most advanced students dictate the pacing or answer all the questions.</li>
<li>Get people talking. The more comfortable they are at talking, the more likely they’ll speak up when they don’t understand something, or to answer someone else’s question.</li>
<li>Allow students time to write and play with code!</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="social-comfort---absolutes">Social Comfort - Absolutes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Try to be more aware of your (possible and understandable) culturally-influenced sexism so you don’t express it during a class</li>
<li>Don’t hit on people. No sexual advances. None. Even at the after-party.</li>
<li>DO NOT ask for student contact information. Feel free to share yours, in a non aggressive way, so students can take initiative to contact you.</li>
<li>Don’t make sexist jokes. Or racist, classist, or ableist jokes. Call people out if they do. A simple “That’s not funny” and moving on quickly with the conversation will often suffice.</li>
<li>Don’t make gender-based generalizations (“Women are better at X, because …”)</li>
<li>Don’t make references to people’s bodies or state your opinion of them.</li>
<li>Don’t use slurs.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="social-comfort-making-the-students-more-comfortable-with-learning-process">Social Comfort: Making the students more comfortable with learning process</h1>
<h4 id="imagine">Imagine:</h4>
<ul>
<li>You’re trying to do something difficult</li>
<li>You’re in a group of strangers, many of whom know how to do it better than you</li>
<li>You’ve tried before but got lost or bored or confused</li>
<li>You don’t feel like you can articulate your thoughts and questions</li>
<li>You don’t know the right names for anything</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="social-comfort-comprehension">Social Comfort: Comprehension</h1>
<h4 id="discussion-points-1">Discussion points</h4>
<ul>
<li>How can you tell if they understand the words you’re saying?</li>
<li>What are good questions to ask to check comprehension?</li>
<li>What did your favorite teachers do to gauge understanding?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="student-comprehension-some-ideas">Student Comprehension: Some Ideas</h1>
<ul>
<li>Pay attention to body language.</li>
<li>People ask questions most often when they are actively processing material. If they aren’t, it might be that the material is too easy or hard. Try to figure out which it is!</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="calling-on-people">Calling on people</h4>
<ul>
<li>Calling on people makes the class more interactive and engaging, and less lecture-y.</li>
<li>Don’t always ask questions to the whole class: call on individuals by name.</li>
<li>Consider breaking the class into two teams and addressing questions to teams.</li>
<li>Ask people what they expect a command to produce BEFORE you hit enter.</li>
<li>Ask “How would you do #{this}?” or “If I wanted to do #{that}, what would I do?”</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Even professional developers are constantly learning new technologies, so being confused is normal.</li>

<li>Mistakes == Learning!</li>
<li>Growth mindset versus fixed mindset</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dealing-with-technical-concepts">Dealing with technical concepts:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Define technical terms! Several times!</li>
<li>Assume anyone you’re teaching has zero knowledge but infinite intelligence.</li>
<li>Remember people’s professional and code backgrounds (QA, DBA, C++, Java, JS) and relate where possible. If they are a cook, try a cooking analogy.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-capability-more-ideas">Technical Capability: More Ideas</h1>
<h4 id="encourage-collaboration-and-interaction">Encourage collaboration and interaction</h4>
<ul>
<li>Explicitly encourage students to try to answer each other’s questions.</li>
<li>If a question is asked, ask if anyone in the class thinks they can explain.</li>
<li>Be especially encouraging of the first few questions, to try to get things rolling.</li>
<li>Good responses to questions: “I’m glad you asked!” or “I actually wondered that, too.” or “Great question!”</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="be-super-positive-always">Be Super Positive, Always</h4>
<ul>
<li>Students have diverse backgrounds. Appreciate this fact.</li>
<li>If they aren’t getting a concept, avoid anything that might shame them.</li>
<li>Don’t be surprised when someone hasn’t heard of something before.</li>
<li>Don’t grab anyone’s keyboard. Avoid taking over unless you think it’s <em>really</em> necessary. Ask before you do. “Mind if I drive for a sec?” But really, don’t.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-capability-even-more-ideas">Technical Capability: Even More Ideas</h1>
<h4 id="walk-the-middle-path">Walk the Middle Path</h4>
<ul>
<li>Don’t go too deep for your class level, but also, don’t gloss over things.</li>
<li>When trying to be accurate, it’s easy to go down a rabbit hole of specificity. Avoid.</li>
<li>Work with the TAs to make sure no one goes down that rabbit hole. Accountability!</li>
<li>Explain the big picture of a command <em>before</em> they type it in.
<ul>
<li>i.e., before typing the command to deploy to Heroku, explain the difference between localhost and Heroku.</li>
</ul></li>
