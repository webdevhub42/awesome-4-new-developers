<h2 id="general-teaching-advice">General Teaching Advice</h2>
<p>When planning, don’t think about what <em>you’re</em> going to do. Think about what <em>they’re</em> going to do.</p>
<h2 id="metaphors-and-stories-for-teaching-programming">Metaphors and Stories for Teaching Programming:</h2>
<p>A program is like a recipe. There’s two parts: a list of ingredients and a list of instructions. Think of code as the instructions and data as the ingredients.</p>
<p>Also, to extend the metaphor, think about doubling a recipe: the instructions don’t change even though the data are different this time.</p>
<p>Computer memory is like a warehouse with lots of boxes. Each box has something inside (the data) and it also has a label (the variable name).</p>
<p>The command line as Zork. You are “in” a room (a directory) and can either act on things in the room (commands) or move to a new room (cd). It’s very important that you know where you are! Learn how to read the command line, and do an “ls” (or “dir”) to look around.</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Have one volunteer be a runner to remind people when it’s 10 minutes until the next break. (This worked really well.)</li>
<li>Make sure all of the projectors have Mac adaptors</li>
<li>Handouts with all of the code that people need to type</li>
<li>Tell people at the beginning that the slides are online</li>
<li>Have a volunteer leader, make sure they are distributed evenly</li>
<li>Advertise that the Friday night setup is <strong>required</strong>, send notes out 1 week ahead of time, so people can get started ahead of time</li>
<li>USB keys and/or DVDs with the big stuff like XCode</li>
<li>Ask the venue about bike policy (can participants bring bikes inside?) and communicate that to participants ahead of time.</li>
<li>Get a good night’s sleep before the class, it is important to be well rested and fresh when teaching or TA’ing.</li>
<li>Start with live coding - watch and type along, don’t even use slides. make sure students &amp; teachers irb prompts display line numbers, so we can say go to line 32</li>
<li>Go into IRB to practice basic concepts first, don’t discuss what agile and a variable is in the abstract right away. Learning by doing first and talking later worked better.</li>
<li>At the very beginning, show a designed version of app so people can recognize it as finished product like other web sites they see: screenshots are on Sarah Allen’s site.</li>
<li>Have TAs wear different badge colors so they can recognize each other.</li>
<li>Discuss rubyisms where appropriate. use code to show elegance &amp; readability of ruby vs other languages: each vs (for i; i = “lame”; i ++)</li>
<li>Ask students to discuss what they learned, what they thought of it, at end of the day. As beginning of wrap-up session or just before it.</li>
</ul>
