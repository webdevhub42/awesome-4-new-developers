<p>These activities are mostly taken from <a href="http://bowperson.com/">Sharon Bowman</a>’s excellent books: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ten-Minute-Trainer-Teach-Quick-Stick/dp/0787974420/">The Ten-Minute Trainer</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Training-Back-Room-Aside-Learn/dp/0787996629/">Training From the Back of the Room</a>. For each activity, <strong>print out instructions and put them up on a wall</strong>. These are ideas and options: don’t try and do them all! :)</p>
<h1 id="warm-up-exercises-a-week-before-the-workshop"><a name="warm-upexercises"></a> Warm-up exercises (a week before the workshop)</h1>
<h2 id="what-you-know-and-whats-your-plan"><a name="whatyouknowandwhatsyourplan"></a> What you know, and what’s your plan</h2>
<p>Send students an email, asking them two of these questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are three things you already know about programming? (Small things or big things! Who does it? What can you make? Why do people write software?)</li>
<li>What do you want to learn?</li>
<li>What do you plan to do with what you learn?</li>
</ul>
